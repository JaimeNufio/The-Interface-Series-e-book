<blockquote>
<pre><code>Goodnight, to every little hour that you sleep tight

May it hold you through the winter of a long night

And keep you from the loneliness of yourself

Heart strung is your heart frayed and empty

Cause it&#39;s hard luck, when no one understands your love

It&#39;s unsung, and I say

Goodnight, my love, to every hour in every day

Goodnight, always, to all thats pure that&#39;s in your heart 
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>Goodnight, may your dreams be so happy and your

Head lite with the wishes of a sandman and a night light

Be careful not to let the bedbugs sleep tight nestled in your covers

The sun shines but I don&#39;t

A silver rain will wash away

And you can&#39;t tell, it&#39;s just as well

Goodnight, my love, to every hour in every day

Goodnight, always, to all that&#39;s pure that&#39;s in your heart
</code></pre>
