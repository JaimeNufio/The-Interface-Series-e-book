I know why now. I hope you feel better. Depression and other mental illnesses are so easily treated in my universe. Just hop in a bed and live out a fantasy. Some choose to stay in those dreams forever. 

*Vanilla Sky*, a movie recommended to me recently, is a good example. A Self-scripted dream that you can live in forever. 

I am glad I don't have to return to the feed realm right now. I rather enjoy skinny-dipping under the moon and stars. Dancing with fireflies. The taste of cold wine and grapes. The true warmth of another person's skin on mine. The real purr of a cat. Maybe we will buy a dog soon, one of the very large breeds.
