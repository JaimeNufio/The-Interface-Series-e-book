I can tell you that we lost years coming here. I am no longer as old as I was, I am now about 20 and Ben is 24. Fake ID's were a must, if you want to live anywhere besides a seedy motel on the outskirts of towns. 

My only guess is because we went reverse on a timeline, and across multiple dimensions, to land where we did not exist, but others believed in the story.  

There is a terrifying theory that a friend sent to Nick that gives her explanation. It is even here on the "Narrative" for everyone to find.
