<div class="md"><p>I know why now. I hope you feel better. Depression and other mental illnesses are so easily treated in my universe. Just hop in a bed and live out a fantasy. Some choose to stay in those dreams forever. </p>

<p><em>Vanilla Sky</em>, a movie recommended to me recently, is a good example. A Self-scripted dream that you can live in forever. </p>

<p>I am glad I don&#39;t have to return to the feed realm right now. I rather enjoy skinny-dipping under the moon and stars. Dancing with fireflies. The taste of cold wine and grapes. The true warmth of another person&#39;s skin on mine. The real purr of a cat. Maybe we will buy a dog soon, one of the very large breeds. </p>
