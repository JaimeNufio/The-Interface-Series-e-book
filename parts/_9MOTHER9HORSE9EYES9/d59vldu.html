<div class="md"><p>Mother locks me in the cage and sits down at the kitchen table. I scream and cry but she doesn&#39;t move. Her horse eyes stare at the wall. The sun sets very slow and the room goes dark. She is just the shape of a black mountain sitting at the table.</p>

<p>When the sun rises her eyes are still on the wall. &quot;You were bad. Your magic was bad. You won&#39;t be bad again,&quot; she says.</p>

<p>&quot;I hate you!&quot; I shout. I do I hate her hate her hate her.</p>

<p>Mother&#39;s birds giggle. She stands up from the table and all her golden flies scramble around. The bars in the cage slide to the side like magic. She reaches in and grabs me with her crab hand. It hurts so bad and I scream and kick at her but she doesn&#39;t care.</p>

<p>She lifts me up and carries me into the living room.</p>

<p>It is full of cages! When did they get here? There are naked kids inside the rows of cages. They are not scared like me. They are sitting cross-legs with their hands on their knees, sitting nice and still and straight with their eyes closed.</p>

<p>&quot;I will show you what will happen if you are bad,&quot; she says. We go to the back hall. There is the door to the basement. I don&#39;t like the basement. I cry and ask her to please let me go please please. She opens the basement door. Usually the basement is dark but not this time. Light shines out of the door. I look inside.</p>

<p>Inside it is not the basement.</p>

<p>It is alive.</p>

<p>Grim stuff of the news lately. Gunshots popping like fireworks. People scrambling through shaky footage. Cops dead in the streets.</p>

<p>It hit 100 degrees today. It&#39;s supposed to hit 100 every day this week. What a strange summer it has become.</p>

<p>Nobody can agree on the truth. They say the media is ignoring the problem. They say the media is creating the problem. The protesters are the problem. The cops are the problem. The whole thing is a false flag operation so Obama can take our AR-15s away. It&#39;s a false flag operation so they can crack down on Black Lives Matters.</p>

<p>Chemtrails crisscross in the sky. Conspiracy theories clash in the comments section. Single women in your area want to date now. Across the ocean, they&#39;re crucifying people again. </p>

<p>I feel so much different than I did in the spring. Less optimistic. I thought maybe I would achieve the dream of publishing a novel and -- gee, wouldn&#39;t that be neat? But now I don&#39;t feel any excitement about it at all. Whether I publish something or not, I&#39;ll still be this friendless little specter, holed up somewhere, sneaking drinks. Money is pointless for a recluse that never does anything. And fame? A bicycle for a fish.</p>

<p>There is nothing in my future. I&#39;m going back to the past. I&#39;m going to kill it.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Mother doesn&#39;t care what I do so long as I don&#39;t bother her. I make sure not to bother her. When she comes into a room I sneak out quiet as a mouse. I never go into the rooms with cages. I never ever go near the basement. I just stay quiet and make sure not to get in trouble.</p>

<p>I have been practicing my magic. Doing small secret things. I make bread for myself out of stones. I make yummy cookies. My stuffed animals walk around and do fun things. My trucks race around a little track I made. Magic is a lot of fun but I&#39;m afraid of making Mother mad.</p>

<p>How long will Mother stay here? Will it be forever? I think it will be forever. It makes me cry when I think about it. I can&#39;t even think about mom and dad for a little second before I start to cry.</p>

<p>I came up with a neat idea. Lately there are a lot of ideas in my head. Like a crowd of people all talking at once. One idea was very strong and clear.</p>

<p>I tried to bring mom and dad to the house but I couldn&#39;t do it right. My magic fell apart and they turned into stupid cats. It&#39;s because mom and dad are on the outside. I can&#39;t make them do things with magic. I&#39;m not strong enough.</p>

<p>But I can make myself do things. </p>

<hr/>

<p>Shawn told me where the warehouse is. I am going down there. I am being called. By the shape of my entire life, I am being called. The story must end this way. Mother will be down there, and so I will try to destroy her. I&#39;ve thought about bringing some kind of weapon. But what good would a weapon be against her? She who is everything. Who has shaped my live across time and space.</p>

<p>I feel exactly like I do when the evening comes. I have woke up so many mornings, swearing I won&#39;t drink that day, but 7 PM comes and I am walking to the store, feeling none too wise, and I don&#39;t want to be walking to the store, and I know I&#39;m making the wrong choice, but my feet keep moving me closer and closer. I know what I am doing is wrong but I am doing it anyways.</p>

<p>I am coming. Mother. I am coming.</p>
